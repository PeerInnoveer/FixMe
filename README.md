# FixMe

The task at hand is to implement simulation tools for the financial markets that exchange a simplified version of FIX messages.
The tools will be able to communicate over a network using the TCP protocol. The focus in this project are not the trading algos (I'll 
experiment with them after the project is finished), but the implementation of a robust and performant messaging platform.
